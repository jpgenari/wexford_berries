Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- pip3 install -r requirements.txt

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile
- _replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located_

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: heroku login -i
- Set the remote for Heroku: heroku git:remote -a app_name (replace _app_name_ with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
  - git push heroku main

Your project is now successfully connected and deployed on Heroku!
